      //So, the AI only knows what's in its hands

      //Then, at each interaction, it will actually create a decision tree


      //We'll use hash = 'id of the card' * player id. If this card is already in our vizualization's map (senders side), then we delete it.

      //Then, we create a hash and set the value to the offerer.

      //Now, we have a map. We know each player have a certain type of value.

      //We'll only take what other players have , but without showing we have each or each set (one by one, unless we can get a set).

      //So, we simply need to take all the cards we know other players have, slowly.

      //Once in a while, we make some random questions. We gain something : we know that this card is either : In the other players hand, or in the deck.

      //We let three or four turns pass. (If we have exact knowledge of who have it, we put it in our map)


      //Strategies : listen to the information and store it.

      //ask questions to get information (either a player has or doesn't)

      //Take one card at a time, unless you can complete a set.

      //If you made a full 'turn', and you come back for a second card, if there is some randomness, ask a random question, so players don't detect you.

      //Accumulate, and keep in mind what each player have in hand.

      //Then, when to ask for the decisive request? You can't. It's only a bet. But, ways to erase a lot of it.
      
      //Example : both players probably already explained that they wouldn't have it. If no players gave any indication : if a player never made any request of a card, we'll conclude he probably don't have it.
